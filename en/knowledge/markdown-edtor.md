# Problem

As we start writing usimg MarkDown, we need an editor.

# Requirement

1. ***Version Control**, preferrably intergration with [Github](https://github.com)
1. ***Live** Preview
1. ***Offline** Editing, so Win10/Mac/Linux application only
1. ***Customisable **Themes** and **Styles**
1. ***Exportable** HTML Source Code
1. Elegant File management
1. Website/Ebook/PDF generation

# Research

1. [简书](https://jianshu.com)
简书 is the least technical solution. It is by far the most elegant solution for most everyday users.
    1. **Warm color schema** while editing
    1. Good file management with **AutoSave**
    1. Powerful, yet simple editor options
    1. Live Preview, with **Optimisation for Chinese fonts**

It fits almosy all requirement, except for 3. While 简书 Provides mobile app which allows for **mobile** offline editing, it would be a pain in the ass and **inefficient** to write long texts on **small screens**. And since 简书 does not have a offline PC version, it's a deal breaker for us.
 
1. [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com)
Gitbook fits all requirements above. It even supports **AutoExport** to Website/Ebook/PDF. Its Chinese font support is poor, but this can be overcome by writing custom **CSS/SASS/LESS**, and yes, it does support the later two.

1. [SublineText3](sublimetext.com) + OmniMarkdownPreviewer
