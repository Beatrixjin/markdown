Building a new brand? We offer a full branding package, including logo, website, name card, email signature, letter head, and anything else you’ll need to build your brand.

### Logo Design

Whether it’s on a website, on a promotional object, or for a physical store, a logo is one of the first thing your customers will see. Use the expertise of our graphic team to get a unique and personalised logo that will stand out.

A good design requires time and craftsmanship. Typically, it takes us one week to conceptualise and prepare 3 proposals. Once a proposal is accepted, it takes us another week to refine the logo. After the second review, we will finalise the logo, and design other elements.
