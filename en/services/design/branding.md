## Branding

Building a new brand? We offer a full branding package, including logo, website, name card, email signature, letter head, and anything else you’ll need to build your brand.

### Logo Design

Logo is the very first thing your customer will see, whether on your website, promotional materials. Contact our graphic team to get a unique and personalised logo that will stand out.

A good design requires time and craftsmanship. Typically, it takes us one week to conceptualise and prepare 3 proposals. Once a proposal is accepted, it takes us another week to refine the logo. After the second review, we will finalise the logo, and design other elements.

### Visual Identity

1. A Logo Design

A premium brand tells a story of its own. While Logo & Visual Identity might be enough for basic needs, a Premium Branding would convey much more credibility to your customers.
