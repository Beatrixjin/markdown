## App Development

If you’re looking to develop an app, chances are you already have an idea of what the app will do. But what’s next? Should you develop a native app, hybrid app? And how do you develop it? This is where SK8Tech comes in.

If you’re looking for a quick and simple app to display information, with minimal user interaction, we recommend building a Hybrid App. It is faster to build, and costs up to 30% less than native apps to build, and only one set of code needs to be developed and maintained. 

Alternatively, for the best user experience and performance, we recommend developing native apps. They are a lot more responsive to user interactions, and therefore provides a much better user experience and more likely to retain happy customers.

If you’re targeting Chinese Customers, we recommend Wechat Offical Account and Wechat App. For more information, please have a look at ‘Wechat Development’
