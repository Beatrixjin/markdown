## Website Development

Are you looking to develop a website? You’re at the right place. Nowadays there’re unlimited ways to make a website, such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, HTML5 and more. The list goes on and on, but which one is the right strategy for the job?

At SK8Tech, our expertise covers most of popular web technologies. While each project has different requirements, with our wide range of knowledge and experience, we can recommend the most appropriate strategy to handle each case.

### Company Website

If you’re looking for a website to display information, e.g. a portfolio, or a company website, we recommend using WordPress. It is the most popular Customer Relation Management system on internet as of 2016.

### Event Website

If it’s one-time marketing website, e.g. a page for real estate sales, we recommend using HTML5, as it’s better designed, faster to build, and more customisation.
